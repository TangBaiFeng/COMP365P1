Tic Tac Toe Player
For all functions that accept a board as input, you may assume that it is a valid
board (namely, that it is a list that contains three rows, each with three values of
either X, O, or EMPTY). You should not modify the function declarations (the order
or number of arguments to each function) provided.
Once all functions are implemented correctly, you should be able to run python
runner.py and play against your AI. And, since Tic-Tac-Toe is a tie given optimal play
by both sides, you should never be able to beat the AI (though if you do not play
optimally as well, it may beat you!)

taking the original input board and letting the player whose turn it is
make their move at the cell indicated by the input action.

Minimax will ultimately require considering many different board
states during its computation. This means that simply updating a cell
